# Blog in a Box

A quick, all in one stop for someone to get a blog presence up and running.

## Prerequisites

* Docker (if wanting to use the dev container on your local machine). 
* Ruby (if not using the dev container)
* Node (if not using the dev container)

## The Ingredients

This project is created to use the following:

* A dev container. This will allow us to use VSCode to open this project within the dev container we've created, saving you a bunch of setup and hassle.
    * Alternatively, you can use GitHub Codespaces and do this all in a web browser. (cool, right?!)
    * Alternatively, you can open this on your local machine as long as you have the dependencies installed.
* Jekyll -- a popular static site generator
* Minimal mistakes -- a great, clean Jekyll theme that is highly customizable
* GitHub Pages -- this is where we assume your site will be deployed. It is free and excellent.

## Using This Project to Make Your Own Blog

* Update the name within your `devcontainer.json` file to match your blog's name.
